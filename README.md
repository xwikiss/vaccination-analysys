# BCG Vaccination Coverage Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project exploring the dynamics of BCG (tuberculosis) vaccination coverage across different countries over time.

## Project Summary

Initially, the goal was to identify a group of countries that significantly improved their vaccination rates despite starting from a low baseline. During the analysis, however, new patterns emerged that led to a more exploratory and nuanced investigation.

Key highlights from the analysis:

-  **Chad** was identified as a country that has shown noticeable improvement in vaccination coverage.
-  Three different dynamics of vaccination coverage were observed across various countries, each telling a different story.
-  **Sweden**, despite its consistently low BCG coverage, may not indicate a need for intervention — instead, it reflects differences in public health strategies or disease prevalence.
-  Most countries maintain **very high vaccination coverage**, which is reassuring in terms of global public health efforts.

The analysis underlines the importance of **contextual interpretation** — for instance, low vaccination rates may not always imply public health failure but could result from **low tuberculosis incidence or policy decisions**.

##  Limitations & Future Work

- The analysis would benefit from being combined with other datasets, such as tuberculosis incidence or mortality, to better assess the **real-world impact** of vaccination coverage.
- In future projects, I plan to place a stronger emphasis on **data visualization** to enhance interpretability and insight generation.

##  Project Overview

- `bcg_analysis.ipynb` – main notebook containing the analysis (written in Polish)
- `data/` – raw datasets used in the analysis
-  Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  

##  Language Note

>  The notebook is currently written in **Polish**. However, all code, structure, and visualizations are easy to follow. An English version may be added in the future.
